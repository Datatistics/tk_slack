    "# Slack Data Alert System: Architecture Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### SlackTemplates\n",
    "**Purpose:** Contains message templates for different alert formats  \n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "- `template_f1`: Creates a single message with multiple sections\n",
    "- `template_f2`: Creates individual interactive messages for each data row\n",
    "\n",
    "### SlackBlockBuilder\n",
    "**Purpose:** Constructs Slack Block Kit elements  \n",
    "**Responsibilities:**\n",
    "- Creates sections, dividers, contexts, and other block types\n",
    "- Formats fields and metadata in a structured way\n",
    "- Maintains proper Slack Block Kit format\n",
    "\n",
    "### SlackInteractiveElementBuilder\n",
    "**Purpose:** Creates interactive elements like buttons and selects  \n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Smart detection of appropriate element types\n",
    "- Abbreviated action ID generation\n",
    "- Format standardization across element types\n",
    "\n",
    "### ActionIdManager\n",
    "**Purpose:** Manages unique action IDs for interactive elements  \n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "- Generates compact, unique action IDs\n",
    "- Stores metadata with reference IDs\n",
    "- Parses action IDs back into components\n",
    "\n",
    "### MessageMetadataHandler\n",
    "**Purpose:** Manages Slack's invisible message metadata  \n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "- Creates structured metadata with event types and payloads\n",
    "- Attaches metadata to message payloads\n",
    "- Extracts metadata from incoming messages\n",
    "\n",
    "### SlackActionHandler\n",
    "**Purpose:** Processes user interactions with messages  \n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "- Universal handler for all interactive elements\n",
    "- Extracts data from interactions\n",
    "- Stores interactions in Snowflake\n",
    "- Sends appropriate responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### SlackMessageTemplateEngine\n",
    "**Purpose:** Core logic for transforming data into message blocks  \n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "- Extracts metadata, details, and options from data\n",
    "- Builds complete message structures\n",
    "- Formats data according to configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### SnowflakeConnector\n",
    "**Purpose:** Handles database operations  \n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "- Inserts interaction records\n",
    "- Executes queries for analysis\n",
    "- Manages connection to Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Creation Flow:\n",
    "1. **Data Input:** A DataFrame with alert data is passed to a template  \n",
    "2. **Configuration:** View and response settings are applied  \n",
    "3. **Block Building:** The template engine transforms each row into message blocks  \n",
    "4. **Metadata Addition:** Invisible metadata is attached to the message  \n",
    "5. **Message Sending:** Complete messages are sent to Slack channels  \n",
    "\n",
    "### User Interaction Flow:\n",
    "1. **Action Detection:** User clicks an interactive element  \n",
    "2. **Action Handling:** Universal handler captures the action  \n",
    "3. **Metadata Extraction:** Message metadata is extracted  \n",
    "4. **Action Processing:** Action details are processed  \n",
    "5. **Snowflake Storage:** Interaction is recorded in Snowflake  \n",
    "6. **Response:** Appropriate response is sent back to the user  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Key Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Singleton Pattern\n",
    "- Used for `ActionHandler` to ensure consistent state  \n",
    "- Prevents multiple handler instances from conflicting  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Builder Pattern\n",
    "- Used in `BlockBuilder` and `InteractiveElementBuilder`  \n",
    "- Separates construction logic from representation  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy Pattern\n",
    "- Used for different template types  \n",
    "- Allows swapping alert formats based on needs  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Factory Method Pattern\n",
    "- Used in interactive element creation  \n",
    "- Creates appropriate elements based on content  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata Pattern\n",
    "- Invisible data attached to messages  \n",
    "- Enables rich context without cluttering the UI  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Configuration Options\n",
    "\n",
    "### View Configuration\n",
    "- **Detail Columns:** Fields to show as structured details  \n",
    "- **Metadata Columns:** Fields to show as metadata  \n",
    "- **Response Settings:** How to respond to user interactions  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Row-Level Configuration\n",
    "- Each row can override view-level configuration  \n",
    "- Enables dynamic messaging based on data content  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Element Configuration\n",
    "- **Action Type:** Button, select, datepicker, etc.  \n",
    "- **Option Names/Values:** Text and values for interactive elements  \n",
    "- **Response Messages:** Templates for responding to interactions  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Integration Points\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slack API Integration\n",
    "- Uses Slack Bolt for event handling  \n",
    "- WebClient for message sending with metadata  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Snowflake Integration\n",
    "- Records all interactions for analysis  \n",
    "- Stores structured data with reference to message sources  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. System Workflow\n",
    "1. **Data Retrieval:** Data is pulled from Snowflake views  \n",
    "2. **Alert Generation:** Data is transformed into interactive messages  \n",
    "3. **Message Delivery:** Messages are sent to appropriate Slack channels  \n",
    "4. **User Interaction:** Users interact with message elements  \n",
    "5. **Action Handling:** System processes user interactions  \n",
    "6. **Response Generation:** Appropriate responses are sent to users  \n",
    "7. **Data Storage:** Interactions are recorded back in Snowflake  "
